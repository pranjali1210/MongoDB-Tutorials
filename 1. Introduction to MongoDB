Introduction to MongoDB :

1. Started in Feb 2009.
2. MongoDB is a non-relational , Document-Oriented Database.
3. It stores data in the form of database.
4. It uses BSON (Binary JSON) to query database.
5. BSON is Binary representation to store data in JSON Format.
6. Using BSON we can parse data easily and fast.

JSON Issues :

1. JSON is text-based format and text parsing is very slow.
2. JSON's readable format is far from space-efficient, another database concern.
3. JSON only supports a limited number of basic data types.

BSON Overcomes above all 3 issues.

JSON :

1. Standard file format.
2. less fast.
3. Consumes less space.
4. use for Transmission of data.

BSON :

1. Binary file format.
2. Faster 
3. More space is consumed.
4. Use for Storage of data.


IMP :

** MongoDB stores data in BSON format both internally, and over the network, but that doesn't mean you can't think of 
MongoDB as a JSON database. Anything you can represent in JSON can be natively stored in MongoDB, and retrieved just as easily in JSON.


In MongoDB :

Table  = Collection
Row    = Document
Column = Field

Example :

In MongoDB, in one Document we have 6 values, then in second Document we can able to write 7 values also. 
MongoDB Provides us Flexibility and Scalability.
